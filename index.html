        <h3>Work</h3>
	<p>I am a general manager for visuals at Reuters. I work on operations, strategy, and technology for video and photo teams covering world news. My mission is to help organizations use technology to scale the reach and impact of great journalism. I'm involved in the <a href="https://www.starlinglab.org/78days/">Starling Project</a> to improve trust in news imagery.</p>
        <p>Previously, I was the deputy editor of the Reuters global picture desk<label for="picture-desk" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="picture-desk" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">The desk handles all the <a href="https://pictures.reuters.com">news photos</a> Reuters produces. This is where I learned to love metadata.</span> managing a 24/7 team of 50 photo editors in Singapore editing the global news photo file.</p>
	<p>Before that, I covered <a href="https://pictures.reuters.com/Share/g0ps51h51cdcsw2ag8xh22q267ugq3h6">news, sports, and entertainment</a> in Tokyo as chief photographer<label for="photographer" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="photographer" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">This is where I learned to love collaborating with a tight-knit group of reporters, photographers, and editors to win stories..</span> for Reuters in Tokyo.</p>

        <h3>Skills</h3>
	<p>My go-to language is Python, but I dabble in C, C++, and assembly</p>
        <p>For computer vision I mostly use OpenCV<label for="OpenCV" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="OpenCV" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">My proudest moment was finishing the PyImageSearch Gurus <a href="https://www.credential.net/ae4e811f-f3c0-44b3-9668-0d8fd94bce2d">course</a> on computer vision and machine learning.</span> and a few other open source tools.</p>
	<p>I'm a heavy user of Raspberry Pis for my robotics projects.</p>
        <p>And lately I've become 3D printing addict.</p>
