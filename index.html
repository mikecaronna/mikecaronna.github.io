        <h3>Work</h3>
	<p> My mission is to help organizations use technology to scale the reach and impact of great journalism.</p>
        <p> I am a general manager for visuals at Reuters. I work on operations, strategy, innovation, and technology for video and photo teams covering world news. Previously, I was the deputy editor of the Reuters global picture desk<label for="picture-desk" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="picture-desk" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">The desk handles all the <a href="https://pictures.reuters.com">news photos</a> Reuters produces. This is where I learned to love metadata.</span> managing a 24/7 team of 50 photo editors in Singapore editing the global news photo file.</p>
	<p>Before that, I covered <a href="https://pictures.reuters.com/Share/g0ps51h51cdcsw2ag8xh22q267ugq3h6">news, sports, and entertainment</a> in Tokyo as chief photographer<label for="photographer" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="photographer" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">This is where I first experienced the magic that happens when you give innovative journalists cutting edge technology and a strategy that plays to their combined strengths.</span> for Reuters in Tokyo.</p>

        <h3>Skills</h3>
	<p>Working with partners from Technology, Product, Finance, Sales, and Editorial to find innovative solutions to tricky business problems.
	<p>My go-to language is Python, but I dabble in C, C++, and assembly.</p>
        <p>For computer vision I mostly use OpenCV<label for="OpenCV" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="OpenCV" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">My proudest moment was finishing the <a href="https://www.credential.net/ae4e811f-f3c0-44b3-9668-0d8fd94bce2d">PyImageSearch Gurus course</a> on computer vision and machine learning.</span> and a few other open source tools.</p>
	<p>I'm a heavy user of Raspberry Pis and Luxonis Oak-D vision sensors for my robotics projects.</p>
        <p>And lately I've become a 3D printing addict and have the spools to prove it.</p>
