        <h3>Work</h3>
	<p>I am a general manager for visuals at Reuters. I work on operations, strategy, and technology for video and photo teams covering world news. My mission is to help organizations use technology to scale the reach and impact of great journalism. I'm involved in the <a href="https://www.starlinglab.org/78days/">Starling Project</a> to improve trust in news imagery.</p>
        <p>Previously, I was the deputy editor of the Reuters global picture desk<label for="picture-desk" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="picture-desk" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">The desk handles all the <a href="https://pictures.reuters.com">news photos</a> Reuters produces. This is where I learned to love metadata.</span> managing a 24/7 team of 50 photo editors in Singapore editing the global news photo file.</p>
	<p>Before that, I covered <a href="https://pictures.reuters.com/Share/g0ps51h51cdcsw2ag8xh22q267ugq3h6">news, sports, and entertainment</a> in Tokyo as chief photographer<label for="photographer" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="photographer" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">This is where I learned to love collaborating with a tight-knit group of reporters, photographers, and editors to win stories..</span> for Reuters in Tokyo.</p>
        <p>Before Tokyo, I was a freelance photographer and book editor working in Hong Kong and Australia.</p>
        <p>Before freelancing I was a Japanese to English translator and interpreter working in Japan<label for="translator-and-interpreter" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="translator-and-interpreter" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">In the days before Google Translate.</span> and later a reporter for the Asian Wall Street Journal in Hong Kong.</p>
